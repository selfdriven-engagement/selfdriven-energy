## Cardano Catalyst - Proposal Checklist

## #Foundational Work

The selfdriven Foundation has spent five years developing a structured operating system for community self-actuation, built on decentralised identity, Cardano governance principles, and real-world impact design.

Core R&D includes:
- A framework for human–AI–organisation co-evolution (“selfdriven ecosystem”)
- Eight modular “Interfaces” that allow any community to progressively self-govern and self-resource
- Working implementations across education, insurance, cooperative governance, and health
- SSI-anchored proof-of-work for human contribution (Octomics) and community trust
- Applied experience supporting 15+ communities and teams across multiple countries

This foundation ensures that the Cardano deployment of selfdriven is building on proven systems rather than speculative ideas.

### Ecosystem Value Proposition
Cardano benefits by becoming the root-of-trust for communities organising themselves — beyond finance.

selfdriven brings:
- Everyday communities entering Web3 without needing crypto literacy
- Verifiable Contribution → Tokenised Utility → Long-term Value
- A pipeline for Cardano-native SSI, governance, reputation and on-chain services
- Open frameworks communities can adopt today (not hypothetical)
- A path for Cardano to support governments, universities, not-for-profits and mutuals

**In short:** Cardano becomes the chain people use to improve their lives, not just speculate.

### Builder Credentials

The selfdriven team includes:
- Engineers & founders with active Cardano governance roles (MCC, dGov SIG, AVS early contributors)
- SSI specialists implementing KERI/ACDC, Identus, and Verifiable Org Identity
- Experienced system designers with real deployments in cooperatives, insurance, higher education, health and community development
- Teams integrating Lucid, Plutus, Midnight, and zk-proof architectures

Collectively: **deep Cardano alignment + proven delivery history in real-world sectors.**

### Catalyst Standing
- Long-standing contributors across Cardano governance and ecosystem working groups
- Previously funded Catalyst initiatives delivered successfully (where applicable)
- Active involvement in MCC, ICC, and community leadership roles
- Track record of build-share-document execution rather than “paper projects”

The team is known for **over-delivery and ecosystem contribution**, not extractive funding cycles.

### Problem & Use Case
Communities everywhere want to organise, govern, and resource themselves — but lack trusted digital infrastructure.

Today the options are:
- Centralised platforms that extract data & value
- Web3 tooling built for traders, not communities
- Government systems that move too slowly

**Use Case:** a community wants to run programs, support members, share resources, and reward contribution.

With selfdriven on Cardano they can:
1. Issue SSI credentials to establish trusted identity  
2. Capture contribution & participation (Octomics)  
3. Access on-chain governance & decision-making  
4. Create pathways to shared resourcing (mutual funds / co-ops / nodes / projects)

One pattern unlocks dozens of verticals — education, cooperatives, sport, health, housing, mutual insurance, and more.

### Tangible Prototype
Already running live components:
- selfdriven OS interfaces deployed in real organisations
- SSI credential flows for contributors and organisations
- Member dashboards and contribution recording
- Pilot programs in BioHub, education, and mutualisation models
- Community charter + progressive governance templates

This Catalyst proposal **enhances and connects these components to Cardano**, not starts from scratch.

### Technical Approach
1. **SSI + Cardano**
   - DID issuance (did:key + did:web → upgrade path to Identus)
   - Credential proofs streamed to Cardano

2. **Contribution Proof Layer (Octomics)**
   - Verifiable contribution events (KERI chains)
   - Gov metadata & service authorisation

3. **On-chain Services**
   - Payment flows for access to community services (Lucid + CIP-68)
   - DAO starter-kit patterns for community governance

4. **Midnight / ZK optionality**
   - Private proofs of contribution & credential validity

**Design philosophy:** progressively decentralised — start usable, then add cryptography and tokenomics when the community is ready.

### Realistic Scope
12-week delivery with milestone-based releases:
- Weeks 1–3: Standardised flows & credential templates
- Weeks 4–6: Contribution capture + Cardano metadata
- Weeks 7–9: On-chain payments & member governance module
- Weeks 10–12: Documentation, kits, community onboarding & support

Risk-controlled, production-minded, user-first.

### Community Engagement
- Bi-weekly open community calls
- Build-with-us rather than build-for-you (co-design process)
- Documentation + open templates for replication
- Pilot programs with multiple communities
- Workshops and video walkthroughs for adoption
- Social & governance SIG alignment (Cardano in Oceania, education CoP, BioHub)

**Outcome:** dozens of communities prepared to grow inside Cardano, not just one.

## Budget Compliance
- No inflated headcounts or speculative costs
- Budget tied strictly to milestones + deliverables
- Open-source outputs and public reporting
- Clear licensing ensuring Cardano retains ecosystem value
- Zero lock-in — everything is shareable across Catalyst

The funding requested accelerates delivery already in motion and **demonstrably lowers future grant dependence.**
