## Cardano Catalyst Proposal
# Powering a Health Systems Cooperative using Cardano, by selfdriven & beHub

A part of the [selfdriven Health](https://selfdriven.health) initative.

---

## Applicant

### Name

Mark Byers

### Type

Entity (Incorporated)
selfdriven Pty Ltd

---

## Summary

### Budget Information
200,000 ADA

### Time (Duration)
10 months

### Translation Information
No / English

### Problem Statement

*AI enables decentralised health, but it depends on trusted systems. Non-technical health organisations struggle to adopt blockchain and identity tech needed to make it work.*

Traditional Health Care facilities are under pressure.
With the arrival of GAHI as a society we have the opportunity to decentralise health functions.
But for it to work they need highly trustable systems,
But it is difficult for non-technical health system organisations to engage with the blockchain & identity technology in a meaningful way.

### Solution Overview

*Partner with beHub to deploy an open-source Health Cooperative Kit, enabling health organisations to roll out blockchain, SSI and AI-accountable operations across traditional and emerging services.*

Partner with the beHub to run a real implementation project, built using a co-developed open-source Health Cooperative Kit that supports the full journey from definition to deployment.

A cooperative of health organisations will apply and facilitate the introduction of the kit across traditional and emerging health services.

The result is a next-generation health system model where blockchain, SSI and AI accountability are built into everyday health operations.

## Campaign Selection

Cardano Use Cases: Prototype & Launch

### Describe what makes your idea innovative compared to what has been previously launched in the market (whether by you or others)

We can not find any existing product or catalyst proposal that can work from an “intent definition” to a “fully provisioned decentralised cooperative system”.

### Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.

https://coop.selfdriven.health (based on org.selfdriven.app and app.behub.io)
It will demonstrate the existing generic functionality that we will add self-actuation to - ie define-to-provision.

### Describe realistic measures of success, ideally with on-chain metrics

Generation of:
- Coop Script/Plutus Addresses for managing shared assets
- Proofs of identity
- Coop member self-use ie create own wallet - DeFi usage.

## Your Project and Solution

### Solution

### Impact

New Cardano use case for small enterprises and communities;
Repeatable kit lowers adoption friction for future proposals;
Interoperability with SSI/VC standards;
Proof‑of‑good primitives that can extend to recycling, food provenance, and community projects. This increases on‑chain activity, showcases partner‑chain + AVS patterns, and strengthens Cardano’s reputation for accountability with privacy.

### Capabilities & Feasibility

The selfdriven Foundation was founded in 2019 and the team is highly engaged within the Cardano community. It has a robust organisational structure.

### Value for Money

High leverage:
A reusable Kit + a real pilot. Delivers open standards, working code, and a public case study that others can clone. Strengthens Cardano’s positioning for verifiable community processes using partner‑chains and AVS, while keeping costs modest and outcomes concrete.

Small investment with value in:
Network usage - transaction fees
Marketing
Developer on-boarding

Based on:
A real world example of the use of Cardano network & AVS.
On-boarding of new users as part of a community which is key to the growth of Cardano.
The adds a layer of on-boarding through application (user value).
More Cardano brand visibility to a non-crypto ecosystem.
Communities are universal, and healthcare works travel for work, naturally growing the awareness of this type of application of Cardano technology.
