# Cardano Catalyst Proposal
# Powering a Health Systems Cooperative using Cardano, by selfdriven & beHub

https://selfdriven.health

## Proposal Title

Powering a Health Cooperative using Cardano, by selfdriven

## Applicant

### Name
Mark Byers

### Type
Entity (Incorporated)
selfdriven Pty Ltd

---

## Summary

### Budget Information
200,000 ADA

### Time (Duration)
10 months

### Translation Information
No / English

### Problem Statement

Traditional Health Care facilities are under pressure.
With the arrival of GAHI as a society we have the opportunity to decentralise health functions.
But for it to work they need highly trustable systems,
But it is difficult for non-technical health system cooperatives to engage with the blockchain & identity technology in a meaningful way.

### Solution Overview

Work with the beHub to deliver a real use project, based on a co-developed open-source kit - from definition to implementation.
From definition to decentralised auto-provisioning on Cardano.
For a next generation of health systems - AI accountability etc

### Supporting Documentation

### Project Dependencies

- Cardano network
- selfdriven.network

### Project Open Source

## Campaign Selection

Cardano Use Cases: Prototype & Launch

### Describe what makes your idea innovative compared to what has been previously launched in the market (whether by you or others)

We can not find any existing product or catalyst proposal that can work from an “intent definition” to a “fully provisioned decentralised cooperative system”.

### Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.

https://coop.selfdriven.app (org)
It will demonstrate the existing generic functionality that we will add self-actuation to - ie define-to-provision.

### Describe realistic measures of success, ideally with on-chain metrics

Generation of:
- Coop Script/Plutus Addresses for managing shared assets
- Sales transactions - ADA/USDM
- Proofs of identity
- Coop member self-use ie create own wallet - DeFi usage.

## Your Project and Solution

### Solution

### Impact

New Cardano use case for small enterprises and communities;
Repeatable kit lowers adoption friction for future proposals;
Interoperability with SSI/VC standards;
Proof‑of‑good primitives that can extend to recycling, food provenance, and community projects. This increases on‑chain activity, showcases partner‑chain + AVS patterns, and strengthens Cardano’s reputation for accountability with privacy.

**About BioHub with Crafters as the Focus**

The Beyonders “BioHub” in Mallorca is a catalyst empowering island-led innovation in the Balearic archipelago bioregion. Our thesis is to address the underexplored opportunity to focus on place-based innovation and empower local changemakers. Like a venture studio we work at every stage of the project from inception, through team building, validation, MVP development, and ultimately financing and adaptive scaling (aligned with ecosystemic intelligence). The flagship startup spinning out of the Nursery will crack the market on biochar with a contextual, scalable, blockchain-enabled cooperative model for farmers.

High leverage:
A reusable Kit + a real pilot. Delivers open standards, working code, and a public case study that others can clone. Strengthens Cardano’s positioning for verifiable community processes using partner‑chains and AVS, while keeping costs modest and outcomes concrete.

Small investment with value in:
Network usage - transaction fees
Marketing
Developer on-boarding

Based on:
A real world example of the use of Cardano network & AVS.
On-boarding of new users as part of a community which is key to the growth of Cardano.
The adds a layer of on-boarding through application (user value).
More Cardano brand visibility to a non-crypto ecosystem.
Communities are universal, and healthcare works travel for work, naturally growing the awareness of this type of application of Cardano technology.
