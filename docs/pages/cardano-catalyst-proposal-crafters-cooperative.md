It is difficult for health organisations to engage with the Cardano network in a meaningful way.

Based on the real need of health systems to tranform, deliver a “Health Cooperative Cardano Kit”.

From definition to provisioning on Cardano.

ork with the Beyonders Collective to deliver a real use project, based on a co-developed open-source kit - from definition to implementation.

From prototyping to real use.
