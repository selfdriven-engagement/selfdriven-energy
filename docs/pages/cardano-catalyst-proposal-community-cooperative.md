Cardano Use Cases: Prototype & Launch

### Describe what makes your idea innovative compared to what has been previously launched in the market (whether by you or others)

We can not find any existing product or catalyst proposal that can work from an “intent definition” to a “fully provisioned decentralised cooperative system”.

### Describe what your prototype or MVP will demonstrate, and where it can be accessed.

It will demonstrate the existing generic functionality available in the selfdriven network On-Chain (Cardano) Interace and Human Interface,customised for this particular use case - incliding the ability to self-actuate to auto-provisioning by intent definitions (templates).

https://coop.selfdriven.app - based on the existing https://org.selfdriven.app.


### Describe realistic measures of success, ideally with on-chain metrics

Per community:
- Script/Plutus Addresses for managing shared community cooperative assets - 100
- Sales transactions - ADA/USDM - 10 per day after 6 months and then increasing
- DeFi transactions - 100 per day after 6 months and then increasing
- Proofs of identity, credentials & connections - 10 per day.
- Community member indiviudal-use ie create own wallet - DeFi usage. Using selfdriven guides like https://www.selfdriven.support/guides/getting-on-chain/

In total per community:
- “20 cooperative members onboarded within pilot.”
- “100 script addresses within pilot.”
- “9000 transactions (sales + DeFi) processed within first 3 months of going life.”

Number of communities:
- Year 1: 4
- Year 2: 20

## Your Project and Solution

### Solution

Build and pilot a full on-chain operating model for a cooperative, then release it as a reusable and open-source “Community Cardano Kit”.

Define → model the cooperative → deploy the Cardano smart contract kit → onboard members → go live.

#### Membership NFT / credential

Manages cooperative membership + voting rights

#### Wallet + USDM / ADA payment flow

Sales + monthly contributions + shared pool payouts

#### Treasury smart contract

Self-managed community fund with controlled withdrawals

#### Governance module

Proposals, voting, quorum, configurable rules

#### SSI (optional)

Verifiable identity for roles (treasurer, chair, member)

#### Reporting dashboard

Sales, payouts, contributions, member onboarding

#### Autopay & distributions

Member earnings + recurring contributions

#### Human-forward Approach

No blockchain knowledge required. Members interact via:
- Web dashboard
- Wallet connect + QR payments
- “Role-based actions” rather than blockchain jargon

#### Pilot Deployment

The Beyonders Collective becomes the first production user.
They will:
	1.	onboard 25 members
	2.	accept payments in ADA/USDM for artisan goods
	3.	split earnings through the cooperative treasury
	4.	govern decisions collectively

All templates, documents, and modules created for the pilot are published openly.

### Impact

New Cardano use case for small enterprises and communities;
Repeatable kit lowers adoption friction for future proposals;
Interoperability with SSI/VC standards;
Proof‑of‑good primitives that can extend to recycling, food provenance, and community projects. This increases on‑chain activity, showcases partner‑chain + AVS patterns, and strengthens Cardano’s reputation for accountability with privacy.

This project accelerates real-world adoption of Cardano by enabling everyday cooperatives — not just crypto-natives — to operate on-chain without technical knowledge.

Craft and maker cooperatives represent a large, global, and economically underserved category of community-based organisations. They generate value but are constrained by outdated administrative systems, manual accounting, and trust-heavy cashflow management. By giving them a plug-and-play operating system powered by ADA / USDM, this project turns Cardano into a practical economic engine for grassroots enterprises.

The impact is both direct (for the pilot cooperative) and multiplying (for the broader ecosystem):

Direct Impact
	- 25+ members transition to on-chain payments and income distribution
	- Transparent treasury and governance reduce disputes and administrative overhead
	- New income streams for artisans selling goods through the cooperative using ADA/USDM
	- Financial agency shifts from a central coordinator to the collective itself

Systemic Impact
	- The pilot becomes a case study and onboarding blueprint for other cooperatives
	- The open-source “Community Cardano Kit” offers a repeatable pattern of real-world usage
	- Demonstrates clear economic utility of ADA and USDM in daily transactions
	- Strengthens Cardano’s positioning as a platform for inclusive economic participation, not speculation

Network Effects

Each cooperative that launches using the kit creates:
	- additional wallet holders
	- ongoing transaction activity
	- funds retained within Cardano
	- community education ripple effects as members introduce peers

This means one successful project becomes a catalyst for many more, without requiring repeated Catalyst funding.

Why this matters for the Cardano mission

Cardano aims to support prosperity and participation for all.
Cooperatives — especially craft, cultural, and local-enterprise groups — are a perfect match:
	- communally owned
	- democratically governed
	- value created at the edge rather than the centre

By giving these communities digital sovereignty through Cardano, this project directly advances:
	- financial inclusion
	- participatory governance
	- real economic utility for ADA

Impact beyond the pilot

Because the kit is open-source and designed for non-technical adoption, the model can scale into:
	- agricultural and food cooperatives
	- community wellness collectives
	- childcare and education co-ops
	- First Nations / Indigenous community enterprises
	- creative and cultural associations
	- shared-resource collectives (makerspaces, tool libraries, fab labs)

Each new deployment reinforces Cardano as the blockchain of real-world community economics.

This proposal delivers high ecosystem value because:
	- it creates daily, repeatable, grassroots Cardano usage
	- it empowers non-technical people to participate economically
	- it establishes a pathway for global replication without additional funding
	- it strengthens Cardano’s reputation as the blockchain for social, economic and cooperative empowerment

In short:
This is not “blockchain for cooperatives” — it is cooperatives powered by Cardano.
And once demonstrated in the real world, it becomes impossible to ignore.

**About the Mallorca Hub with Crafts-people as the Focus**

The Beyonders “BioHub” in Mallorca is a catalyst empowering island-led innovation in the Balearic archipelago bioregion. Our thesis is to address the underexplored opportunity to focus on place-based innovation and empower local changemakers. Like a venture studio we work at every stage of the project from inception, through team building, validation, MVP development, and ultimately financing and adaptive scaling (aligned with ecosystemic intelligence). The flagship startup spinning out of the Nursery will crack the market on biochar with a contextual, scalable, blockchain-enabled cooperative model for farmers. 

**Feasibility is high for three reasons:**

1. The team has already delivered similar end-to-end systems

The project team has deployed complete organisational operating systems with:
	- smart contracts
	- SSI identity
	- payments
	- governance
	- onboarding toolkits

This reduces both discovery and execution risk.

2. Clear and staged delivery plan

The milestones cover:
	1.	Analysis and UI/UX design
	2.	Technical build
	3.	Pilot and onboarding
	4.	Open-source public release

Each milestone has objective acceptance criteria, measurable outputs, and verifiable evidence.

3. Pilot partner committed from the outset

The Beyonders Collective provides a live organisational environment to validate:
	- payments
	- member onboarding
	- governance
	- treasury distribution

This avoids the “build it and hope someone uses it” problem.

The required technology stack — Cardano smart contracts, wallets, USDM (optional), and web dashboards — is well understood and within team capability. No unproven protocols or dependencies are required for success.

## Final Pitch

### Project Team

The selfdriven Foundation team has been working for more than five years at the intersection of community governance, decentralised identity, and practical real-world blockchain adoption. We specialise in building systems that make complex Web3 tooling usable by everyday people, with a strong focus on education, cooperatives, and inclusive economic participation.

This proposal is led by a multidisciplinary team combining:
	- Smart contract engineers experienced in Cardano development
	- UX and product designers specialising in human-centred design for non-technical users
	- Identity and governance specialists with applied SSI and cooperative governance experience
	- Cooperative advisors and community facilitators supporting real-world organisational change

The team already has production deployments of organisational operating systems across education, insurance, health, and community development — giving us direct experience delivering end-to-end systems, not just proof-of-concepts.

We are confident executing this proposal because we have:
	- a proven model for translating real-world organisational processes into digital and on-chain flows
	- experience engaging non-technical participants and scaffolding change management
	- the entire required skillset in-house, removing dependency risk on external contractors

The team is strengthened by strategic collaboration with members of The Beyonders Collective, who will operate as the live pilot partner. Their direct participation ensures that every design and technical decision is grounded in real cooperative needs, not abstract assumptions.

The cultural philosophy of the team is simple:

If everyday communities cannot use it — it is not adoption.

Our experience, track record, and community-first approach position us to deliver a reliable, repeatable, and community-beneficial operating model for cooperatives on Cardano, and to do so in a way that can be scaled and replicated globally.

### Value for Money

**High leverage:**

A reusable Kit + a real pilot. Delivers open standards, working code, and a public case study that others can clone. Strengthens Cardano’s positioning for verifiable community processes using partner‑chains and AVS, while keeping costs modest and outcomes concrete.

Small investment with value in:
- Network usage - transaction fees
- Marketing
- Real-world on-boarding

This proposal delivers strong value for money because it converts a single funded pilot into a reusable, open-source product that can be adopted by an unlimited number of cooperatives without further Catalyst funding.

Instead of funding technology that benefits one organisation, this funds:
- a fully built cooperative operating model on Cardano
- templates, dashboards, smart contracts, training materials
- a complete onboarding kit for any cooperative

Each future deployment:
- increases real-world on-chain transactions
- creates new recurring users of ADA / USDM
- grows the grassroots Cardano economy

The approach is cost-efficient because:
- the full stack (contracts, UX, docs, onboarding) is built once and reused many times
- the team is already established and requires no ramp-up spending
- no funding is used for token launches, speculative assets, or unnecessary marketing

Every ADA requested contributes directly to:
- engineering
- user onboarding
- open-source infrastructure
- community access

By focusing on production-ready software and real-world economic activation, this project generates multiplying ecosystem value over time, not one-off impact.

Local cooperatives create real value — artisans, cultural groups, food co-ops, First Nations collectives — but they’re held back by spreadsheets, manual accounting, and trust-heavy financial processes.

This project turns a real craft cooperative — The Beyonders Collective — into a fully on-chain organisation using ADA and USDM for sales, income distribution, and treasury management.

And here’s the important part: everything we build becomes a reusable “Community Cardano Kit.”

So once the first cooperative is running, any cooperative in the world can copy the model — no technical background required. That means repeatable onboarding, repeatable transactions, and repeatable value flowing through Cardano long after funding is spent.

This isn’t blockchain for cooperatives — it’s cooperatives powered by Cardano.

One working deployment becomes a catalyst for many more, pushing Cardano directly into everyday community economics. This is grassroots, real-world adoption where it matters most — people helping each other thrive.

## What is a Crafters Cooperative?

This proposal delivers a reusable Cardano-powered “Community Cardano Kit” that enables local craft cooperatives to run their organisation digitally using ADA + USDM — with membership, treasury, payments, identity, and governance working out-of-the-box.

The pilot partner is The Beyonders Collective, a real craft-based cooperative in Mallorca, Spain. The project converts their existing operations into a fully functioning on-chain model and then publishes everything as open-source templates and onboarding resources, enabling other cooperatives worldwide to copy and adapt the model without technical expertise.

Non-technical cooperatives want to benefit from decentralised finance and shared ownership, but:
- blockchain onboarding is too technical
- treasury and revenue pooling systems are hard to operate securely
- no simple UX exists for cooperative payments using ADA / stablecoins
- governance and membership tracking remain manual, inefficient and error-prone

This locks everyday cooperatives — craft groups, community associations, art collectives — out of the Cardano economy.

**Who will use it?**

The Beyonders Collective is confirmed as the live pilot; the output is a reusable kit for any cooperative globally.

**Is it speculation?**

No tokens, no hype. Real payments, real users, real income distribution.

**Will people outside crypto adopt it?**

UX is designed for non-technical users. No blockchain terminology required to participate.

**How does it benefit Cardano?**

Creates recurring payments, new wallet users, and sustainable grassroots economic activity on ADA / USDM.

**What happens after funding?**

No further funding required — the kit is open-source and reusable. Revenue model is optional hosted services, not more Catalyst requests.

**Is the team capable?**
Team has delivered smart contracts + governance + SSI + onboarding in real organisations before.

**What if the cooperative drops out?**

Commitment is formalised before build. If failure happens, the code and kit still launch publicly.

**Is the budget fair?**
