## Cardano Catalyst Proposal - Powering a Health Cooperative using Cardano, by selfdriven

A cooperative as a form of business.

It is difficult for health organisations to engage with the Cardano network in a meaningful way.

Based on the real need of health systems to tranform, deliver a “Health Cooperative Cardano Kit”.

From definition to provisioning on Cardano.

Work with the selfdriven.health to deliver a real use project, based on the co-developed open-source kit - from definition to implementation.

From prototyping to real use.
