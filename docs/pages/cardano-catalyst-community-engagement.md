## Plan

### Proposal Awareness Campaign
- Supporting Media: Create visuals (infographics, slides, memes) and short-form videos that highlight the problem, the solution, and the impact.
- Social Platforms: Share across X, BlueSky, LinkedIn, and Discord groups where Cardano stakeholders are active.
- Video Content: Record 2–3 min “proposal pitch” videos and also seek interviews with Cardano-focused YouTubers/podcasters.

### Personal Engagement
- One-on-One Outreach: Send personal messages/emails to centres of influence (IOG, Intersect, CF members, active SPOs, Catalyst community advisors, builders, DReps).
- Tailored Approach: Frame your outreach around why your proposal is relevant to them and their area of focus.
- Follow-up Conversations: Don’t just broadcast—ask for feedback, suggestions, or partnerships.

### Engagement Process
- Proposal Link in Every Post: Make it effortless for community members to access your proposal.
- Monitor & Respond: Check your proposal page daily; answer all comments/questions promptly.
- Leverage Networks: Encourage team members and partners to also share the proposal link and engagement posts into their own networks.

### Key Messaging Framework

When engaging, highlight four main points in a clear, repeatable format:
1.	Problem Being Solved – why this matters for the Cardano ecosystem.
2.	The Solution – what your proposal is doing.
3.	The Impact – what difference this will make, measurable outcomes if possible.
4.	Relatedness – how it ties into other Cardano initiatives, communities, or ecosystem goals.

Always close with:
-  “Here’s the proposal link – we’d love your feedback and support.”

### Extras
- AMA (Ask Me Anything): Run a short AMA session on Discord or Twitter Spaces.
- Cross-Collaboration: Where possible, tag or partner with other proposals to build momentum.
- Consistency: Share updates at least 2–3 times a week across platforms, not just once.
