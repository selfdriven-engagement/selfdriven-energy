## Helping communities self-actuate their energy creation, supply & coordination.

### Scope
- Community energy needs
- AI planning
- Provisioning
- Economic Management / Sharing

### Modes
- Passive
- Active

### Forms
- Intelligence - the energy that organises against entropy.
- Electrical
- Communications
- Economic

### Community Collaborations
- [Cardano Catalyst Proposals](/cardano-catalyst/)

    - [Cardano Catalyst Proposal Community Engagement](/cardano-catalyst-community-engagement/)


### Research
- Intelligence as a form of organisational energy that counters the dispersive force of entropy.
    - Is it all then just a matter of compute energy?
